# Cricket Score Mangement system Using c++ in visual studio.❄️❄️

I've developed a comprehensive Cricket Management application using C++, leveraging Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. The application seamlessly stores and manages detailed records, including scores, facilitating efficient team management. It incorporates robust replay functionality for post-match analysis, emphasizing a technically sound and modular design for optimal code organization and scalability.
